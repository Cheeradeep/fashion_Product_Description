**Overview**

This project aims to classify fashion products based on their attributes (color, type, season, and gender) using deep learning. A ResNet50 model is trained on the Fashion Product Images Dataset to predict these attributes from product images.

**Methodology**

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Data visualization and insights.

Checking for class imbalances and missing data.

Deep Learning Model:

Used ResNet50 for image classification.

Fine-tuned the model for multi-label classification.

Testing:

Evaluated the model on Amazon fashion product images.

**Results**

The ResNet50 model achieved high accuracy in predicting fashion attributes.

The model was tested on real-world images from Amazon.

**Future Improvements**

Train on a larger dataset for better generalization.

Use Object Detection to detect multiple fashion items in a single image.
